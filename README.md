# Slotify

A Spotify-clone Web development project for me to learn advanced HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, Bootstrap and PHP.
This project will showcase my progress in the mentioned programming languages and technologies.


This Repo consists of a Registration page, which requires users to enter desired details to be used upon login request. User must provide a Username(AlphaNumeric not less than 8 Char), Name, Family Name, Email address and a password(AlphaNum with at least one Uppercase letter and at least one special character). Upon clicking the submit button, procedural PHP functions will then verify if the details entered have met the requirements of the form. An error message will be displayed on the page for errors.  


This Repo consists of a Login page, which requires users to enter log in details provided at the time of registration. Procedural PHP functions will then verify the details entered against the MYSQL database entries. An error message will be displayed on the page for invalid  user information details entered.      

After a success login, the user will be redirected to the index page of the website.
